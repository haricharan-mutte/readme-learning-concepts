âœ… Tips for Practice
Area	Tip
Brute-force	Always write brute-force first, then optimize
Hashing	Think HashMap<Character, Integer> as default
StringBuilder	Prefer over string concatenation in loops
Two pointers	Common in reversal, palindrome, and window logic
Edge cases	Handle "", null, spaces, case sensitivity
